# Vehiclecounter
This uses a v5yolo model to do the operations....the model will automatically be downloaded when you run the code...
this project can count vehicles from images and videos as shown in the demo video ....
at first it was only counting the vehicles than i asked AI about that and it suggested me to use classname then i did so.. 
Made through the use of tuto and debugging through AI.
